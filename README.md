# Short-term-climate-prediction
This is the Python code for all short-term climate prediction internships of NUIST.
The course is compulsory. 
If the content of the internship does not change from year to year,
I think it's better to spend time doing something more meaningful.( •̀ ω •́ )y
Enjoy your time.
