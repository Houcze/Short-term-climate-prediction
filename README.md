# Short-term-climate-prediction
short-term climate prediction is a required lesson in NUIST for students majoring in Atmospheric Science.

These days python has become more and more popular than Fortran between these students.

With numpy and the ease of use and flexibility of python, we can verify some ideas much more easily.

No compiler, no ivf, no ram issues.

I've gathered some code of the experimental part of the course, short-term climate prediction, implementation in python.

Most of them have been proved correct.

It can be a reference for those who want to change, from fortran to python.
